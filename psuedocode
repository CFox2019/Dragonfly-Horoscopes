Horoscope
This site is created to give thier users a current up to date horoscope.
This will also keep record of previous requested horoscopes.
The user views the sites intro page consisted of standard horoscope info and themes
then the user presses the the next page button which takes them to a log in page that takes thier data and stores it for the
next time.
The user is able to view all previous dates and days a horoscope was viewed.
We will be bringing in a an astrology api and using our own database consisting of previous inquiries.
The site will allow navagation to each page and allow user to re input new data once done.

logic ---
1. set up a recurring process that requests horoscopes from our api every days
2. use the responses to create a horiscope record for each sign with a date = today's date
3. when a user logs on to the site, we (using a GET request) query our horiscope table to show them their horiscope: 
    SELECT text FROM horoscope WHERE date = (current date) AND sign_id = (req.session.sign_id);
