# Description 
### In our full-stack application `Dragonfly Horoscopesâ€™ we combined  our back end server with a database, and API to take in a user profile that includes a birthdate to then provide a daily horoscope.  The application includes user authentication all displayed on an intuitive front end. Through the use of agile development methodologies, we collaborated to bring you DragonFly Horoscopes.
